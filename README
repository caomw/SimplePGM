Learning and inference methods for probabilistic graphical models in Matlab

This is a reference implementation that I wrote for myself. It is not meant to be fast, but it is
meant to be straightforward. Licensed under GPLv2 for non-commercial research purposes only.

The current implemented algorithms are:

Learning
----------
maxlikelihood: Maximum Likelihood (requires a lot of parameters, needs cleaning)
contrastive: Contrastive Divergence
perceptron: Structured Perceptron-Style
cuttingplane: Cutting Plane for Structured SVM

Inference
----------
Marginal
==========
lbp_sp: Sum Product Belief Propagation
meanfield: Mean Field Approximation
mcmc: Markov Chain Monte Carlo

Decoding
==========
lbp_mp: Max Product Belief Propagation
annealing: Simulated Annealing
icm: Iterated Conditional Modes

Other
----------
gibbs: Gibbs Sampler
metropolis: Metropolis-Hastings Sampler
